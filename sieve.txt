...Sieve of Eratosthenes...
Finding primes in Range [1:n] without using Sieve of Eratosthenes
We can check if each number is a prime or not. To check if the number ‘i’ is prime
we will traverse all the numbers till [2, sqrt(i)] can check if they divide n or not.
Similarly, we do this for all the n numbers.
Time Complexity: O(n sqrt n)
Space Complexity: O(1).
