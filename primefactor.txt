Prime Factorization using Sieve
Explanation:
while( num ! = 1 ):

We keep on dividing it with its smallest prime factor.

The smallest prime factor is pre-calculated using a slightly modified prime sieve.
Since we start from 2 and go on, we mark the first multiple as the spf.
Preprocessing for Sieve: O(n log log n)
Time Complexity for factorization: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(n).

Sieve of Eratosthenes
Algorithm: We start from 2, and on each encounter of a prime number, we mark
its multiples as composite.
Time Complexity: O(n log log n)
Space Complexity: O(n).
